# Labyrinth solver!
A visualizing tool for the Breadth First Search algorithm.

Placing items
-----------
![Choose what to place](https://github.com/Kaloyan-Dimitrov/labyrinth-escape/blob/master/images/Placing.png?raw=true, "Choose what to place")

From this menu you can choose what to place.
You can place walls at any given moment, even while the algorithm is running!
When you choose empty cell, you can delete walls the same way you place them.

Clear canvas
-----------
![Clear Everything Button](https://github.com/Kaloyan-Dimitrov/labyrinth-escape/blob/master/images/ClearEverything.png?raw=true, "Clear Everything!")

With this button you clear all the placed walls on the grid.

Starting up the algorithm
-----------
![Solve Button](https://github.com/Kaloyan-Dimitrov/labyrinth-escape/blob/master/images/Solve.png?raw=true, "Solve!")

With this button you start the algorithm. After that you can no longer erase walls and move the end and start points, until you clear the result.

Clearing the result
-----------
![Clear Path](https://github.com/Kaloyan-Dimitrov/labyrinth-escape/blob/master/images/ClearPath.png?raw=true, "Clear Path!")

When you press this button the result of the algorithm is cleared and after that moving the start and end points is again allowed.
